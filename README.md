## 📘 Project Description
This project aims to detect fraudulent (spam) emails using machine learning, specifically the Naive Bayes classifier. By analyzing the content of emails, the model predicts whether a message is spam or not  - spam (ham), helping to automate email filtering and improve inbox security.

## 🎯 Objectives
 - Automatically classify emails as spam or not spam.
 - Improve email security using natural language processing (NLP).
 - Build a lightweight, efficient, and accurate machine learning model for text classification.
## 🧰 Tech Stack & Tools
-  Programming Language: Python
-  Libraries:
   * scikit-learn – Machine learning & Naive Bayes
   * pandas, numpy – Data handling
   * re, NLTK – Text preprocessing
   * matplotlib, seaborn – Visualization
## 📂 Project Structure
### 📊 Dataset Information
 - Dataset Used: SMS Spam Collection
 - Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
 - Format:
 * label: Indicates "spam" or "ham"
 * message: The actual email or SMS content
## 🔄 How It Works
1. Preprocessing: Clean and normalize text (lowercase, remove punctuation, stopwords).
2. Feature Extraction: Convert text to numeric features using CountVectorizer or TF-IDF.
3. Model Training: Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
4. Prediction: Classify new messages as spam or ham.
5. Evaluation: Measure model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
